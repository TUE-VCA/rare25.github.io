                <h2>&#10067; The Clinical Problem &#10067;</h2>
                <p>Early-stage cancers are difficult to detect in routine clinical practice. They often present with subtle or non-specific signs and 
                    are easily missed among the many normal or benign findings seen every day. Catching these cases early is crucial, as timely diagnosis 
                    can significantly improve patient outcomes (<a href=https://www.nature.com/articles/nrc1041>Etzioni <i>et al.</i>, 2003</a>). However, 
                    these cancers are rare, and their subtle features make them hard to distinguish—even for experienced clinicians. This rarity poses a 
                    major challenge when developing automated tools to support diagnosis. Most data comes from normal or non-cancerous cases, making it 
                    difficult to train models that can reliably identify the few critical anomalies without being overwhelmed by the common findings.</p>    
                
                <h2>&#128202; The Need for a Benchmark &#128202;</h2>
                <p>Given the difficulty of detecting rare and subtle early-stage cancers, there is a pressing need for well-designed tools to support 
                    clinicians. Computer-aided detection (CADe) systems hold promise—but developing and evaluating these systems in low-prevalence settings 
                    remains a major hurdle. In real-world clinical environments, early cancers are vastly outnumbered by normal or benign findings. This 
                    imbalance can skew model performance and lead to misleading results if not properly addressed during development 
                    (<a href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841525000520>Godau <i>et al.</i>, 2025</a>). Systems trained on 
                    artificially balanced datasets may appear accurate in testing but often fail in clinical practice, where the true distribution is heavily 
                    skewed. Without rigorous benchmarking, CADe systems risk two major pitfalls: being too sensitive and generating a flood of false 
                    positives, or being too conservative and missing early cancers. Striking the right balance between sensitivity and specificity is 
                    essential. That’s why a carefully constructed benchmark is crucial—to provide a realistic, standardized way to evaluate performance under 
                    conditions that mirror the clinical reality. This challenge aims to fill that gap.</p>
                
                <h2>&#127919; The RARE 2025 Challenge &#127919;</h2>
                <p>The RARE 2025 Challenge focuses on building a classification system that can accurately detect early-stage cancer in a real-world, 
                    low-prevalence setting—specifically, in patients with Barrett’s Esophagus (BE). BE is a condition where the lining of the esophagus 
                    changes, increasing the risk of developing cancer. During routine endoscopic surveillance, early signs of cancer in BE can be very subtle 
                    and are often missed. Yet catching these changes early is critical. When found in time, patients can be treated with a simple endoscopic 
                    procedure, with long-term success rates above 90% 
                    (<a href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016508513015965?via%3Dihub>Pech <i>et al.</i>, 2014</a>). But if these early 
                    signs are missed and the disease progresses, outcomes become much worse—with five-year survival rates dropping to around 15% 
                    (<a href=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/esophagus-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html>American Cancer Society, 2025</a>). 
                    Despite these high stakes, the prevalence of early neoplasia during surveillance of BE patients is exceptionally low—typically below 1% 
                    (<a href=https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1103042>Hvid-Jensen <i>et al.</i>, 2011</a>). This makes it especially difficult to gather 
                    enough data for model training and evaluation, and increases the risk of systems being either too cautious or too aggressive. This challenge is 
                    designed to address exactly that. Participants are asked to develop models that can detect these rare but vital cases—without 
                    overwhelming clinicians with false alarms. Success in this task means building systems that are not just 
                    accurate in theory, but practical and trustworthy in the clinic.</p>
