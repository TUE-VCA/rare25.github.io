                <h3>&#128215; Open Training and Tuning Set (3095 cases) &#128215;</h3>
                <p>
                    This dataset is made available for all participants and researchers, and consists
                    of fully anonymized endoscopic images. It is made publicly under a non-commercial CC-BY-NC-SA license. The dataset comprises
                    2937 normal, non-dysplatic cases and 158 neoplasia cases, and will be <b>the largest publicly available dataset focussed on Barret's esophagus
                    in endoscopic images to date</b>. With that, we hope to provide a benchmark for the development of AI algorithms for Barrett's esophagus and 
                    significantly advance research opportunities in this field.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All training images were acquired using the Exera III system (Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The training data was collected retrospectively 
                    via an automated query from EndoBase, designed to broadly retrieve all stored images from the system. From this dataset, Barrett’s 
                    esophagus-related images were manually identified and extracted. No standardized imaging protocol was in place during the original acquisition. 
                    As a result, imaging parameters, techniques, and device settings may vary, depending on local clinical practices and individual operator 
                    preferences. The data was sourced from routine endoscopic surveillance procedures at two medical centers in the Netherlands. Data collection 
                    occurred as part of standard clinical workflows, without the involvement of a specific expert group. Therefore, detailed information regarding 
                    the experience level of the medical professionals involved is not available.

                <h3>&#128213; Closed Validation and Testing Cohort (xxx/yyy cases) &#128213;</h3>
                <p>
                    This dataset will remain private and is solely available to the challenge organizers. It will be used for the evaluation of the algorithms during
                    the Open Development Phase (Validation Cohort) and Closed Testing Phase (Testing Cohort). The Validation cohort consists of ... non-dysplastic and
                    ... neoplasia cases, while the Testing cohort consists of ... non-dysplastic and ... neoplasia cases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the validation and test images were acquired using the Exera III system (Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The dataset was constructed using both
                    retrospective and prospective data collection methods. The restrospective images were retrieved from EndoBase archives using pre-identified 
                    patient lists, each associated with corresponding pathology reports. All retrieved images were manually reviewed to assess the presence or absence 
                    of abnormalities. The prospective images were obtained through a standardized prospective acquisition protocol, carried out by expert endoscopists 
                    specializing in Barrett’s esophagus screening. The Validation and Testing cohort includes cases from 12 medical centers participating in the BONSAI 
                    consortium, as described in <a href=https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(23)00199-1/fulltext>Fockens <i>et al.</i> (2023)</a>.
