                <h2>&#128221; Task Description &#128221;</h2>
                <p>
                    The core task of the RARE 2025 challenge is <strong>binary classification</strong>: determining whether an endoscopic image of a Barrett’s Esophagus (BE) patient
                    contains early neoplasia or not. The goal is to build AI algorithms that can identify subtle but critical signs
                    of early-stage cancer while maintaining a low false positive rate — a key requirement in real-world clinical use.
                </p>
                <h2>&#129504; Open Development Phase &#129504;</h2>
                <p>
                    During the Open Development Phase, participants will have access to the training data to develop their models. They can submit their models to the <strong>validation set</strong>, and a <strong>live leaderboard</strong> will display performance based on these submissions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The private validation set is <strong>primarily intended to help participants verify that their models are functioning correctly on the platform</strong>. While it provides performance feedback, it is not advised to solely rely on the validation set for final model selection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, the validation set is <strong>small compared to the eventual test set</strong>, so leaderboard results during this phase may not accurately reflect final performance. Participants are encouraged to focus on building models that generalize well to unseen data.
                </p>

                <h2>&#129514; Closed Testing Phase &#129514;</h2>
                <p>
                    In the Closed Testing Phase, participants will submit their final models or predictions for evaluation on the full test set. The official results will be announced during the <strong>EndoVis workshop day at MICCAI 2025</strong> in Daejeon, South Korea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following the workshop, the <strong>final leaderboard</strong> will be published, reflecting performance on the test set and determining the official ranking of all participants.
                </p>

                <h2>&#128221; Participation Rules &#128221;</h2>
                <p>
                    To ensure fairness and transparency, all participants in the RARE 2025 challenge must adhere to the following rules:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>All participants must register as part of a team, even if the team has only one member. Each participant may only join a single team.</li>
                    <li>Anonymous participation is not allowed. Verified profiles must accurately display each participant’s real name, affiliation, and country.</li>
                    <li>Members of sponsoring or organizing institutions (Eindhoven University of Technology, Amsterdam Medical Centers) are welcome to participate but are <strong>not eligible</strong> for awards or final rankings.</li>
                    <li>Use of external data or pre-trained models is allowed if they are publicly licensed and disclosed in the algorithm description and/or publication.</li>
                    <li>To participate in the Closed Testing Phase, teams must submit a short arXiv paper (2–3 pages) and a public/private GitHub link to their code under a permissive license.</li>
                    <li>The organizers reserve the right to disqualify any team for unethical behavior or non-compliance with challenge rules.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>A full set of rules will be available on the deployment platform. All participants are expected to review and follow them.</strong>
                </p>
